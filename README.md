# funclib

## Library of Commonly Used Functions in Ecology

This project aimed to re-implement a small function library
created by a student project with more recent techniques.

## Ideas

* make use of the R package **shiny** for an interactive web interface,
* integrate parameter fitting capabilities
* make it an R package
* extend the set of functions, including numerically solved
  differential equations
